This is an example personal homepage built with [bio-site](https://github.com/GeeLaw/bio-site). It features simplicity and integration with BibTeX.

## Building Blocks

```blog-bib

@comment
{
Use #bibitem_Venue_Key to refer to "Venue:Key".

It is possible to have multiple BibTeX blocks, which will be rendered independently. For example, you might want to have one block for each of "Publications", "Pre-prints", and "Manuscripts".

To support more information links (e.g., add "slides" or "pdf" links),
see "builder/marked.0.3.6/bibtex-service.js" line 109.
